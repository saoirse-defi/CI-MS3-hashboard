# Code Institute, Milestone 3: hash-board

## Introduction

In response to the financial crisis of 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper outlining the first decentralised public ledger technology to hit the world stage.
The network has stood strong to this day and inspired 1000s of projects build off of Satoshi's vision of a decentralised world. We now have a robust ecosystem of smart contract, NFT and decentralised financed platforms.
Pandora's box has been opened and there is no turning back.

One of the main benefits of cryptocurrencies is the public availability of the blockchain data. Previously corporations would protect vast silos of data in order to monetize it & increase their stranglehold on the market.
Public blockchains granted software developers to the ability to compete with much larger corporations by providing value to the user & not by monetizing siloed data.

Even though cryptocurrencies have been around for more than a decade, adoption rates are still relatively low. I believe this is due to the perceived complexity of the technology.
My goal for my Code Institute Milestone Project 3: Data Centric is to simplify the experience for the user by allowing them to view their blockchain data in a more intuitive graphical interface.

#### Current Blockchain Interfaces

This cryptocurrency dashboard project will be reading transactions from the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is the market leader in smart contract technology with the largest community & developer base.
Etherscan is the leading blockchain API which allows you to view transactions, smart contracts, user accounts & on-chain metrics. After using Etherscan for the past 4 years, I have seen that very few improvements have been made to the UX. 
I believe this is the key to onboarding new users and taking smart contract platforms to the next level.

#### Planned Features

* 
* Metamask Integration
* Customised pricing data only pulling favorite coins or coins detected from their Metamask
* News articles related to favorite coins
* Community token/NFT distributed once certain milestones have been achieved
* Transaction history displayed to the user in a more visually pleasing way


## Considerations

## UX

### Project Goals

Leading into this project, my goals were to introduce new people into the cryptocurrency ecosystem by creating a more user-friendly interface.
This will allow users to view their blockchain transactions with more clarity & reduce some of the anxiety that new user face when starting out in crypto.
This application doesn't just limit you to viewing your own transactions, the user will be able to search any transaction on the ethereum chain and save it to their dashboard.
With this feature, users can track Ethereum whales & the movement of funds within important smart contracts. 

### User Goals

The target audience for this application reflects people within the age group of your average cryptocurrency user (16-35).

##### The user's goals are:

* To be provided with blockchain data in a format that is easy to navigate and understand.
* To use this data in order to track funds moving through the blockchain.
* The ability to save important transactions and have them displayed in a separate area.
* The power to remove favourited transactions from their dashboard.
* Recieve email notifications if an address associated with your account is searched via hash-board.com

### Developer & Business Goals

##### Tier Structure

Limit the user to a set number of API calls and favourite transactions. This will incentivise active users to upgrade to the premium tier.

Premium tier users will have unlimited access when adding favourite transactions.
